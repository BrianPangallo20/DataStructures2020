Sample values bill = 100
Pay 100
credit 1
bill = bill - credit - payment
remaining balance = -1
apply penalty after payment

Pay 60
penalty = 5 (100 * .05)
bill = bill + penalty - payment
remaining balance 42

Pay 20
penalty = 8
bill = bill + penalty - payment
remaining balance 88

algorithm
1. input bill and pay
2. if(pay >= bill)
	credit = smaller of 10, bill * .1
	bill = bill - credit - payment
   else if(pay >= bill / 2)
	penalty = bill * .05;
	bill = bill + penalty - pay
   else if(pay >= bill * .2 && pay < bill / 2)

   else if(pay > 0 && pay < bill * .2)

   else
	something bad, die
